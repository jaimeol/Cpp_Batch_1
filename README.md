# 🧠 C++ Modules 00–04

> A deep dive into the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in modern C++.

---

## 🧩 Overview
The **C++ Modules 00–04** from 42 introduce the foundations of **Object-Oriented Programming** and **C++ syntax** through progressive, hands-on exercises.  
Each module builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism**, and **memory management**, while reinforcing code style, safety, and design clarity.

These projects serve as the transition point from procedural C programming to a **structured and object-oriented mindset**.

## 🧱 Modules Breakdown

### 🧮 Module 00 – Basic Syntax & Classes
Focuses on:
- Basic I/O with `iostream`
- Namespaces, functions, and classes
- Access specifiers and member functions
- The concept of encapsulation

### 🧰 Module 01 – Memory, Pointers, and References
Introduces:
- Stack vs heap allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- References and pointer behavior
- Dynamic object management
- The importance of the **Rule of Three**

### 🧱 Module 02 – Ad-hoc Polymorphism & Operator Overloading
Covers:
- Fixed-point arithmetic implementation
- Function overloading and operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical Form
- Encapsulation and data abstraction

### 🧩 Module 03 – Inheritance
Explores:
- Class hierarchies and inheritance types
- Access control (`public`, `protected`, `private`)
- Virtual functions and method overriding
- Reusability and specialization through class design

### ⚙️ Module 04 – Subtype Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
Develops:
- Dynamic polymorphism with virtual methods
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
- Deep understanding of polymorphic behavior
- The importance of destructors in inheritance chains
